# Smart-Health-Monitoring-System-using-ESP-32

The goal of the project is to use the ESP-32 microcontroller to utilize multiple sensors like GPS sensor, heartbeat 
sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and smoke sensor to provide us with real-time data. The implementation 
can be useful in a variety of applications, like the development of a smartwatch.
